      	'Yellow: Through My Eyes' is a project that follows my memories in where I saw yellow metaphorically and or physically. Recently, I have felt like the color has been prominent in my life and links me to my fondest moments but also has sparked my curiosity to question the use of yellow in everyday life. The viewer clicks through photos and videos of memories or thoughts I had.I wanted to make it simple by just clicking through photos like if you just found and album or looked through someones online diary. <br> By: Christina Murcia
